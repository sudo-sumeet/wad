*****Question 1*****

pwd: print name of current/working directory

top: display Linux programmes

less: opposite of more :P .Less is a program similar to more, but it has many  more  features.
       Less  does  not  have to read the entire input file before starting, so
       with large input files it starts up faster than text  editors  like  vi. 
       Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on
       a variety of terminals.  There is even  limited  support  for  hardcopy
       terminals.
       
man: an interface to the on-line reference manuals. 'man' is the manual pager of the system.

cat: concatenate files and print on the standard output

chmod: change file mode bits. chmod changes the permissions of each
	     given file according to mode, where mode describes the permissions to
	     modify. Mode can be specified with octal numbers or with letters.
       
*****Question 2*****

chmod a+x modifies the argument's mode while chmod 755 sets it.
chmod a+x will add the exec bits to the file but will not touch other bits. 
For example file might be still unreadable to others and group.
chmod 755 will always make the file with perms 755 no matter what initial permissions were.
On the other hand, chmod +x changes file permissions to executable.

*****Question 3*****

A Read–Eval–Print Loop (REPL), also known as an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e. single expressions), evaluates them, and returns the result to the user; a program written in a REPL environment is executed piecewise. 
The term is most usually used to refer to programming interfaces similar to the classic Lisp machine interactive environment.
Common examples include command line shells and similar environments for programming languages, and is particularly characteristic of scripting languages.
